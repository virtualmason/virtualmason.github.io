         </br><h4>Founders Sales Program</h4>
           <p> The first sales hire should be the founders of the company because no one else knows, loves or has as much invested in the product. You bring the product knowledge and I bring the process and together we will build an outbound sales blueprint that we will work before you invest in bringing in more salespeople and systems.</p><p> We will partner together to get an understanding of your ideal customer and what makes them tick. We will get the messaging together, scripts, give demos, self-motivation, emails, technology, answers to objections, understand how to close the sale, be resilient and the rest of a repeatable sales system. We will both make calls setting appointments, giving demos and closing deals together.<p> Once we know what works we will make sure it's all documented and you're comfortable with the sales process. At this point not only are you now in a better position to not only sell your product but to hire a sales team, train them, motivate them and have a better understanding of your business and fix sales process
      
problems because you didn't just read about it, you participated in the process. This is way better then hiring a bucnh of people wasting money becuase you have no idea what works.  </p>
<h4>Sales Workshop</h4>
         <p> This is a short and fast quick start program for you and your team to get a sales system up and running. It's an online workshop that is designed to be the top 20% of information that you and your team need to get started in 8 hours with the understanding everything else you need will come in time with self-study and access to ongoing consultations with me. </p>
         <h4>Hourly Sales Consulting</h4>
         <p>Whatever you need during your hour from advise, to call monitoring, help with your scripts, motivation for your team to me cold calling for you</p>

        <blockquote>"Floyd is a tenacious salesman and was eager and enthusiastic to try all new techniques. He was committed to the success of the program and put 100%+ effort behind it. He performed well above the other freelancers we had working on the project. I admire his dedication to sales and his constant effort to improve his work product and his skillset. 

It is a shame that our program ended because I would have loved to keep Floyd on. I will continue to look for opportunities to hire Floyd in the future. Best of luck Floyd and thank you for all of your work!!"
